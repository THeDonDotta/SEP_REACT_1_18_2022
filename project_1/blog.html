    <h1>Poole scores 20 points as the Warriors hold off Jazz</h1>
    <p> Stephen Curry was a little bit off but that did not stop the Warriors from pulling out a big win. Even without Curry at the top of his game the warriors were able to pull out the win on back of Jordan Poole and players like Damion Lee who came off the bench to hit four big 3-pointers. </p>
